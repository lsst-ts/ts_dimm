The Astelco DIMM consists of a 12 inch Ritchey-Chr√©tien telescope taking images of target stars at a specific cadence.
The aperture of the DIMM telescope consists of a mask with a hole on one side and a prism on the other side.
Due to turbulence in the atmosphere, the wave fronts arriving at the two holes slightly differ, allowing for seeing measurements.

DIMM Interface
==============

The DIMM hardware runs autonomously.
The DIMM CSC interacts with the hardware via the OpenTPL protocol and collects the DIMM telemetry.
